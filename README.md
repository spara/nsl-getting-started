# Getting Started with NearSpace Labs API and Anaconda

The [`nsl.stac`](https://pypi.org/project/nsl.stac/) Python package lets you find aerial imagery by area of interest, data, and other attributes. It also downloads Near Space Labs Geotiffs and thumbnails. The client connects to Near Space Labs [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) service for imagery metadata queries and imagery server to retrieve imagery.

## What you need for this tutorial

Request access to the NearSpace Labs [API](https://nearspacelabs.com/#nearspacelabs). You need these credentials to access services.

For this tutorial, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which is a Python distribution that includes [JupyterLabs](https://jupyter.org/install). JupyterLabs provides a web-based interactive environment for data science and machine learning.

We will also use [`nsl.stac`](https://pypi.org/project/nsl.stac/) to connect to NearSpace Labs STAC server and retrieve imagery.

### Best practice

For each Python project, it's best practice to create a virtual environment that contains the packages required by the project. Anaconda includes a package manager called  [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Run the following to create a new virtual `conda` environment and activate it.

```bash
$ conda create --name venv python=3.8
$ conda activate venv
```

### Install packages

We need to add the JupyterLabs and numpy to our environment. Note that `nsl.stac` requires `numpy` 1.17.3 or greater and we will install it in the conda environment before installing `nsl.stac`.

```bash
$ conda install jupyter
$ conda install numpy=1.17.3
$ conda install matplotlib
$ conda install -c conda-forge rasterio
```

### Adding the nsl.stac package

The conda package manager uses the [Anaconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/) or [CondaForge](https://conda-forge.org/) repositories. The `nsl.stac` package is not available in those repositories, but we can still use pip to install it from the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) repository. 

```bash

$ pip install nsl.stac
```

### Starting Jupyter

We can start a Jupyter server with your NearSpace Labs credentials

```
$ NSL_ID="<my_id>" NSL_SECRET="my_secret" jupyter notebook
```

## For the impatient

Open a new notebook.

Copy and paste the code example into the notebook to download and view a geotiff.

## Concepts: Protobufs, gRPC, and Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)

The `nsl.stac` library connects to NearSpace Labs' Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) which holds metadata about imagery. It uses the gPRC, a modern framwork for requesting services from the STAC server. The requests are formatted as a protocol buffer which is a binary structured format for serializing data.

Details about each are listed below:

**Definition of [STAC](https://stacspec.org/)**:
> The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification provides a common language to describe a range of geospatial information, so it can more easily be indexed and discovered.  A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

**Definition of [gRPC](https://grpc.io)**:
> gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.

**Definition of [Protocol Buffers (protobuf)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)**:
> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.

To summarize:
- You can think of Protobuf as a strict data format like xml or JSON + linting, except Protobuf is a compact binary message with strongly typed fields
- gRPC is similar to REST + OpenAPI, except gRPC is an [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) framework that supports bi-directional streaming
- STAC is a  searchable catalog  of metadata for geospatial datasets or assets.
